Hey, I'm Jayden, and welcome to my portfolio! I was born and raised in Anchorage, Alaska, to first-generation immigrants, and I'm now operating out of Southern California.

I'm currently a sophomore at the University of Southern California, studying computer science and game development with a minor in artificial intelligence.

I've been playing video games since I was a kid, and some of my favorites are Team Fortress 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 2077, and Marvel Rivals.

This website is a work in progress, so stay tuned for future updates!
