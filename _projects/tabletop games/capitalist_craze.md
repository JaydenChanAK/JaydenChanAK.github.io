Capitalist Craze is a game that pits two teams, each with a CEO and an architect, in the greatest marketplace of them all: the marketplace of ideas. Each team will name their company and place their headquarters on a board bursting with potential profits. Each turn, or era, teams alternate placing infrastructure and factories, while attempting to sabotage each other at the same time. The twist? CEOs choose what to place, Architects place them– and they’re not allowed to communicate.
